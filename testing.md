# Testing

* essential part of program development 
  * ongoing, but at the end
  * begins before start coding
  * test suite
* is NOT debugging
* cannot guarantee correctness; can only prove wrongness

## Human testing:
* code inspection: team of 3-6 people looking for:
>### Common types or error
>**data error**: wrong type, zero divide, initilization problems, poor data structure  
>**logic error**: loop, boundary values, incorrect input, incorrect formula  
>**interface errors**: missing parametersm, abstraction issues  


## Machine testing:

**Black box testing**: testing before knowing how program works  
**White box testing**: all of the logical paths has been run at least once  
**Grey box testing**: testing with part of knowledge of program implementation
